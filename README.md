## Project purpose:
Creating a decision support system for the price strategy with the AB testing.

## Project details:

A game company gave gift coins to its users for the purchase of items in a game. Using these virtual coins, users buy various tools for their characters. The game company **did not specify a price for the new item** and provided users to **buy this item at the price they wanted.** With the sales dataset of this new item, we will investigate what the price of this item should be.

The questions to be answered within the scope of this project are as follows:

1- Does the price of the item differ according to the categories?

2- Depending on the first question, what should the price of the item be?

3- It is required to "be able to move" about the price. Create a decision support system for the price strategy.

4- Calculating item purchases and revenues for possible price changes.

## Dataset:
pricing.csv: The dataset includes the sale price of the new item with the category id of the player.
